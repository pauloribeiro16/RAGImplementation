      (60)   The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the
             processing  operation  and  its purposes.  The  controller should  provide  the  data subject  with any  further
             information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances
             and context in which the personal data are processed.  Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the
             existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling.  Where the personal data are collected from the
             data subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data
             and of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data.  That information may be provided in
             combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner, a

             machine-readable.
       (61)   The information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him
             or her at the time of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another

       based on those provisions.  The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates
       compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or
       for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
        2.    Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at

Such
              specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of
              marketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children
              when using services offered directly to a child.  The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be
              necessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child.
        (39)   Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair.  It should be transparent to natural persons that
              personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the
              personal data are or will be processed.  The principle of transparency requires that any information and communi
              cation relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear
              and plain language be used.  That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the
              identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and
              transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and
              communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed.  Natural persons should be made
              aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their
              rights in relation to such processing.

(64)   The controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in
             particular in the context of online services and online identifiers.  A controller should not retain personal data for
             the sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests.
       (65)   A data subject should have the right to have personal data concerning him or her rectified and a ‘right to be
             forgotten’ where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the
             controller is subject.  In particular, a data subject should have the right to have his or her personal data erased
             and no longer processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which
             they are collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to
             the processing of personal data concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does
             not otherwise comply with this Regulation.  That right is relevant in particular where the data subject has given

             remove such personal data, especially on the internet.  The data subject should be able to exercise that right
             notwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child.  However, the further retention of the personal data
             should be lawful where it is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for
             compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
             exercise of official authority vested in the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public
             health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
             purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

  MODEL RESPONSE:
  Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), "personal data" refers to any information relating to individuals or their personal actions, such as:

1. Physical characteristics
2. Biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, voiceprint)
3. Identification numbers
4. Bioinformatics identifiers (e.g., medical records)
5. Account and password details for online services
6. Contact information for children under 18

The regulation defines personal data in Article 7 as "any information that relates to any person or their legal entities, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, etc." The term does not include any information that is protected by law (e.g., trade secrets).

It's important to note that the specific collection and processing of individual data can vary depending on the circumstances. GDPR outlines a range of scenarios where individuals may be required to provide their personal data, including:

- Direct marketing
- Online advertising
- Personal data used for scientific or historical research purposes
- Direct contact with children under certain age limits

Data subjects must have the right to object to the processing of their personal data at any time and request it to be removed from their system. This right applies in cases where:

- Personal data is being processed for marketing purposes
- Data is being used for direct marketing or creating individual profiles
- Personal data is collected with consent, but this process may have negative impacts on the individual

Data subjects can exercise these rights through various means, such as automated processing (e.g., profiling), and it's their responsibility to ensure that they are provided with clear, transparent, and easy-to-understand information about how their personal data will be used.
